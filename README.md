# FIV_FeLV_Transmission

This repository features code and data used in the manuscript "Transmission of one predicts another: Apathogenic proxies for transmission dynamics of a fatal virus"

The analysis pipeline follows the following steps:
1. Phyloscanner analysis of FIV genomes
2. Exponential random graph model (ERGM) analysis of FIV transmission network
3. FeLV transmission simulation based on FIV model and 3 alternative models
4. Analysis of simulation results

## 1. Phyloscanner analysis of FIV genomes
FIV genomes are available in GenBank. See [Malmberg et al 2019](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4693550)

Phyloscanner analysis parameters are provided in "Phyloscanner_networks/Phyloscanner run parameters.csv"

## 2. Exponential random graph modeling
